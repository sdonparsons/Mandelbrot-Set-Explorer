# MandelbrotSetExplorer

Description:
Desktop application that displays the mandelbrot set. Utilises pygame library to render to a window.

How to use:
To zoom in, click on the point in the window you wish to see magnified. The window will re-render, zoomed in, centred around the point you clicked.

Performance issues:
The further you zoom in, the more calculations are required, and performance will markedly begin to suffer after zooming in enough times. Addressing this issue is for future updates.

Thank you.
